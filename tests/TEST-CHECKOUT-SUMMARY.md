## Testing Process

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run the test with full debugging
node test-iframe-interaction.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/test-checkout
2. Click "Quick Fill Test Data" button
3. Wait for "All iframes present - CollectJS is READY for input!" in debug logs
4. Manually enter payment data:
   - Card: 4111111111111111
   - Expiry: 12/25
   - CVV: 123
5. Click "Test Validation" to check field status
6. Click "Submit Payment" to process

## Current Status
- ✅ All form fields properly configured
- ✅ Debug logging system working
- ✅ CollectJS loads and creates iframes
- ❌ Iframe fields not accepting input (tokenization blocked)

## API Integration
When tokenization succeeds, the form will:
1. Send complete customer and billing data to `/api/checkout/process`
2. Include the Fitspresso 6-pack product ($294)
3. Use shipping address as billing if checkbox is checked
4. Process through Inngest and NMI gateway

## Next Steps
1. Resolve iframe input issue (likely requires NMI support)
2. Verify tokenization key format with NMI
3. Test in production mode
4. Check browser security settings
