# CollectJS Integration Status Report

## Current Issue
The CollectJS tokenization is not working because the iframe fields are not receiving keyboard input when automated tests or users type in them. The validation callback reports "Field is empty" even after attempting to fill the fields.

## What's Working
✅ CollectJS script loads successfully
✅ CollectJS.configure() executes without errors (after removing errorCallback)
✅ All three iframes (card, expiry, CVV) are created and inserted into the DOM
✅ fieldsAvailableCallback triggers correctly
✅ validationCallback triggers when fields change
✅ Form submission calls CollectJS.startPaymentRequest()

## What's NOT Working
❌ Iframe fields don't accept keyboard input programmatically
❌ Fields report as "empty" even after typing
❌ Token callback never fires because fields are empty
❌ No tokenization occurs

## Key Findings

### 1. Configuration Issue
The NMI documentation link (https://support.nmi.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360009713318) suggests there might be specific configuration requirements for Direct Connect integration that we're missing.

### 2. Field Interaction Problem
- The iframes are created but seem to be in a state where they don't accept input
- This could be due to:
  - Cross-origin security restrictions
  - Missing configuration parameters
  - Incorrect tokenization key format
  - Timing issues with iframe content loading

### 3. Environment Variables Confirmed

## Test Pages Created

### 1. `/test-checkout` - Simple Debug Page
- Clean implementation with extensive logging
- Shows real-time status of CollectJS
- Debug buttons for validation and manual tokenization
- Visual feedback for each stage

### 2. Test Scripts
- `test-simple-checkout.js` - Automated test with proper delays
- `test-iframe-interaction.js` - Interactive test with DevTools
- `MANUAL-TEST-STEPS.md` - Step-by-step manual testing guide

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Manual Testing Required**
   - Open http://localhost:3000/test-checkout
   - Wait for "All iframes present" message
   - Manually click inside each iframe field
   - Type test data very slowly
   - Check if fields accept input

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for any security errors
   - Check for cross-origin warnings
   - Monitor network requests to NMI

3. **Verify with NMI Support**
   - Confirm tokenization key format is correct
   - Ask about Direct Connect specific requirements
   - Check if test merchant account has proper permissions

### Potential Solutions to Try

1. **Different CollectJS Configuration**
   ```javascript
   // Try with explicit inline configuration
   window.CollectJS.configure({
     variant: 'inline',
     styleSniffer: false, // Try disabling style sniffer
     tokenizationKey: 'vZ668s-j859wu-6THDmy-kA46Hh',
     // Try adding explicit field configuration
     fields: {
       ccnumber: {
         selector: '#card-number',
         placeholder: '0000 0000 0000 0000'
       },
       ccexp: {
         selector: '#card-expiry',
         placeholder: 'MM/YY'
       },
       cvv: {
         selector: '#card-cvv',
         placeholder: '000'
       }
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Check Tokenization Key Format**
   - Current key: `vZ668s-j859wu-6THDmy-kA46Hh`
   - Might need to be prefixed or formatted differently

3. **Test in Production Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   Sometimes iframe security is different in development vs production.

4. **Try Different Browsers**
   - Chrome might have stricter iframe policies
   - Test in Firefox or Safari

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Run the simple test page
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000/test-checkout

# Run automated test with debugging
node test-iframe-interaction.js

# Check browser console for errors
# Look for messages like:
# - "Blocked a frame with origin..."
# - "Cross-origin frame access denied"
# - Any CollectJS specific errors
```

## Questions for NMI Support

1. Is the tokenization key format correct for Direct Connect?
2. Are there specific domain/origin requirements for test mode?
3. Is there a test tokenization key we should use?
4. Are there additional configuration parameters required?
5. Is there a working example of CollectJS with Direct Connect?

## Current Status: BLOCKED
The integration is properly configured but the iframe fields are not accepting input. This appears to be a configuration or security issue that needs to be resolved with NMI support or by finding the correct Direct Connect documentation.
