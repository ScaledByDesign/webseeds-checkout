# Complete Fix for CollectJS Multiple Initialization Issue

## Problem
CollectJS was attempting to initialize multiple times, showing repeated console messages:
```
⏭️ CollectJS already initialized, skipping...
⏭️ CollectJS already initialized, skipping...
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **FormData in Dependencies Array** (Fixed Previously)
The CollectJS initialization useEffect included `formData` in its dependencies, causing re-initialization attempts every time form data changed.

### 2. **Parent Component Function Recreation** (Main Issue)
The parent component (`app/checkout/page.tsx`) was recreating the callback functions (`handlePaymentSuccess` and `handlePaymentError`) on every render. Since these were in the CollectJS effect dependencies, it caused the effect to re-run repeatedly.

## Complete Solution Applied

### Step 1: Remove FormData from Dependencies
**File**: `components/NewDesignCheckoutForm.tsx` (Line 549)
```javascript
// Before:
}, [formData, order, apiEndpoint, onPaymentSuccess, onPaymentError])

// After:
}, [order, apiEndpoint, onPaymentSuccess, onPaymentError])
```

### Step 2: Memoize Parent Component Callbacks
**File**: `app/checkout/page.tsx`

1. **Added useCallback import**:
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react'
```

2. **Wrapped startPaymentStatusPolling**:
```javascript
const startPaymentStatusPolling = useCallback((sessionId: string) => {
  // ... function body
}, [router, pollCount])
```

3. **Wrapped handlePaymentSuccess**:
```javascript
const handlePaymentSuccess = useCallback((result: any) => {
  // ... function body
}, [router, startPaymentStatusPolling])
```

4. **Wrapped handlePaymentError**:
```javascript
const handlePaymentError = useCallback((errorMessage: string, errors?: Record<string, string>, sessionId?: string) => {
  // ... function body
}, [router, createUserFriendlyValidationErrors])
```

5. **Wrapped createUserFriendlyValidationErrors**:
```javascript
const createUserFriendlyValidationErrors = useCallback((errors: Record<string, string> | string): ValidationError[] => {
  // ... function body
}, [])
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Stable Function References**: By using `useCallback`, the functions maintain the same reference across renders unless their dependencies change.

2. **Prevents Unnecessary Effect Re-runs**: The CollectJS initialization effect now only re-runs when:
   - The order changes
   - The API endpoint changes
   - The actual function logic needs to change (rare)

3. **Maintains Functionality**: The callbacks still have access to current state through their closures and DOM reading.

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary CollectJS initialization attempts
2. **Clean Console**: No more repeated initialization messages
3. **Stability**: CollectJS initializes once and remains stable
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between initialization and data updates
5. **React Best Practices**: Proper use of useCallback for optimization

## Verification

✅ No more repeated "CollectJS already initialized" messages
✅ Payment processing still works correctly
✅ Form data is captured accurately during tokenization
✅ No lint errors related to React hooks
✅ Callbacks maintain proper functionality

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
- Parent component recreated functions on every render
- Timer updates (every second) caused constant re-renders
- Each re-render created new function references
- New references triggered CollectJS effect re-run
- Effect would check initialization and skip, but log message

### After Fix
- Functions are memoized with useCallback
- Function references remain stable across renders
- CollectJS effect only runs when truly needed
- Clean, efficient component lifecycle
