# Error Message Cleanup Fix

## Problem
When validation errors were returned from the API, the error messages displayed technical field names like:
- "Please check your customer info.email"
- "Please check your customer info.zip code"

These messages were not user-friendly and exposed internal field naming conventions.

## Solution
Enhanced the error message processing to:
1. **Remove technical prefixes** - Strip "customer info.", "customerinfo.", and "customer." prefixes
2. **Clean field names** - Convert dot notation to spaces and properly capitalize
3. **Add more field mappings** - Handle variations like "zip code", "postal code", "phone number" etc.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Field Name Cleaning (Default Case)
```javascript
// Before: Would show "customer info.email"
// After: Shows "Email"

// Cleaning process:
1. Remove "customer info." prefix
2. Replace dots with spaces
3. Capitalize each word properly
```

### 2. Improved Field Matching
Added support for more field name variations:
- `email`, `email address`
- `phone`, `phone number`, `phonenumber`
- `zip`, `zip code`, `zipcode`, `postal code`, `postalcode`
- `address`, `street address`, `billing address`
- And more variations for all fields

### 3. Pre-Processing Field Names
The switch statement now cleans field names before matching:
```javascript
const cleanedField = field.toLowerCase()
  .replace('customer info.', '')
  .replace('customerinfo.', '')
  .replace('customer.', '')
```

## Result
Error messages are now clean and user-friendly:
- ❌ "Please check your customer info.email"
- ✅ "Please enter a valid email address"

- ❌ "Please check your customer info.zip code"
- ✅ "Please enter a valid ZIP code"

- ❌ "Please check your customer.phone"
- ✅ "Please enter a valid phone number"

## Benefits
1. **Better UX** - Users see friendly, understandable error messages
2. **No Technical Leaks** - Internal field naming is hidden from users
3. **Consistent Messaging** - All error messages follow the same friendly format
4. **Helpful Suggestions** - Each error includes specific suggestions for fixing the issue
