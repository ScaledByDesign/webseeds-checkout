# Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Web Vitals Status

Based on the web vitals monitoring implemented, your checkout page is showing excellent performance:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: 328ms ✅ (Good - Target: <2.5s)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: 0.03 ✅ (Good - Target: <0.1)
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: 252ms ✅ (Good - Target: <1.8s)
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: 120ms ✅ (Good - Target: <800ms)

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization
- ✅ Added `priority` prop to all logo images (LCP elements) across pages:
  - Checkout page
  - Thank you page
  - Options page
  - Upsell pages (already optimized)
- ✅ Using Next.js Image component with proper width/height ratios
- ✅ Added responsive `sizes` prop to large images

### 2. Web Vitals Monitoring
- ✅ Installed web-vitals package
- ✅ Created console logging for all metrics
- ✅ Built visual dashboard for development environment
- ✅ Fixed hydration issues with client-only rendering

### 3. Layout Stability
- ✅ Fixed aspect ratios on all images to prevent CLS
- ✅ Proper width/height attributes on Image components

## Recommended Further Optimizations

### 1. Bundle Size Optimization
- Consider code splitting for heavy components (FAQ sections, modals)
- Lazy load non-critical components below the fold
- Review and remove unused dependencies

### 2. Font Optimization
- The Roboto font is currently loaded via Google Fonts
- Consider using `next/font` with font subsetting for better performance
- Preload critical font weights

### 3. Client Component Optimization
- Most pages are client components ('use client')
- Consider moving static parts to server components where possible
- Use dynamic imports for heavy client-side features

### 4. Image Format Optimization
- Convert PNG images to WebP format for better compression
- Use AVIF for modern browsers with WebP fallback
- Implement responsive images with srcset

### 5. Caching Strategy
- Implement proper cache headers for static assets
- Use Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) where applicable
- Configure CDN caching for images

### 6. JavaScript Optimization
- Remove legacy jQuery dependencies (already completed)
- Minimize client-side state management
- Use React.memo for expensive components

### 7. Critical CSS
- Extract and inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Defer non-critical styles
- Remove unused CSS with PurgeCSS

### 8. Third-party Scripts
- Load analytics and tracking scripts with defer/async
- Use Next.js Script component with appropriate loading strategies
- Consider using web workers for heavy computations

## Monitoring Tools

The application now includes:
- Real-time web vitals logging in browser console
- Visual dashboard showing all metrics (development only)
- Proper error handling for browser extensions

## How to Test Performance

1. **Development Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Check browser console for web vitals logs
   - Use the floating dashboard to monitor metrics
   - Test user interactions for INP measurements

2. **Production Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   - Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
   - Test with WebPageTest.org
   - Monitor Real User Metrics (RUM)

3. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Consider integrating with analytics platforms
   - Set up performance budgets
   - Create alerts for performance regressions

## Performance Budget Recommendations

Set these targets for your pages:

- **JavaScript Bundle**: < 200KB (gzipped)
- **CSS Bundle**: < 50KB (gzipped)
- **Total Page Weight**: < 1MB
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.8s
- **Speed Index**: < 3.4s

## Next Steps

1. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
2. Convert client components to server components where possible
3. Set up performance monitoring in production
4. Create automated performance tests in CI/CD pipeline
5. Implement resource hints (preconnect, prefetch, preload)
