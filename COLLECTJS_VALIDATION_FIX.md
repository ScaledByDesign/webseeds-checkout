# CollectJS Card Validation Fix

## Problem
The checkout form was not properly validating card details (card number, expiry, CVV) before submission. The validation logic existed in some places but was:
1. Missing from the main `handleSubmit` validation
2. Not preventing form submission when card fields were invalid
3. Missing the `fieldsValid` state that was being referenced

## Issues Found

1. **Missing State**: `setFieldsValid` was being called but the state didn't exist
2. **Incomplete Validation**: The `handleSubmit` function validated all fields EXCEPT card details
3. **Weak Enforcement**: Even when card validation failed, the form would still try to submit
4. **Poor Error Messages**: Card validation errors weren't clearly communicated to users

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing State
```javascript
const [fieldsValid, setFieldsValid] = useState(false)
```

### 2. Added Card Validation to handleSubmit
```javascript
// 4. CollectJS Card Validation - CRITICAL for payment processing
if (collectJSLoaded && window.CollectJS && window.CollectJS.isValid) {
  const ccnumberValid = window.CollectJS.isValid('ccnumber')
  const ccexpValid = window.CollectJS.isValid('ccexp')
  const cvvValid = window.CollectJS.isValid('cvv')
  
  if (!ccnumberValid) {
    newErrors.cardNumber = 'Please enter a valid card number'
  }
  if (!ccexpValid) {
    newErrors.expiry = 'Please enter a valid expiration date (MM/YY)'
  }
  if (!cvvValid) {
    newErrors.cvv = 'Please enter a valid security code (CVV)'
  }
}
```

### 3. Enforced Card Validation Before Submission
```javascript
if (!ccnumberValid || !ccexpValid || !cvvValid) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Some payment fields are invalid')
  
  // Show specific error messages
  let cardErrors = []
  if (!ccnumberValid) cardErrors.push('Card Number')
  if (!ccexpValid) cardErrors.push('Expiration Date')
  if (!cvvValid) cardErrors.push('Security Code (CVV)')
  
  onPaymentError(`Please check your payment information: ${cardErrors.join(', ')}`)
  setLoading(false)
  return // Stop submission if card fields are invalid
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Error Message Mapping
Added card field mappings for user-friendly error messages:
- `cardNumber` → "Card Number"
- `expiry` → "Expiration Date"
- `cvv` → "Security Code (CVV)"
- `payment` → "Payment Information"

## Validation Flow

### Before Submission
1. User fills out form including card details
2. CollectJS validates card fields in real-time via `validationCallback`
3. Field validity is tracked in component state

### During Submission
1. All non-card fields are validated first (email, address, etc.)
2. CollectJS card fields are validated using `window.CollectJS.isValid()`
3. If ANY field is invalid (including card fields):
   - Specific error messages are shown
   - Form submission is prevented
   - User is directed to fix the errors

### Card-Specific Validation
- **Card Number**: Must be a valid card number format
- **Expiry Date**: Must be valid MM/YY format and not expired
- **CVV**: Must be 3-4 digits depending on card type

## Benefits

1. **Complete Validation**: All fields including card details are now properly validated
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Users get specific feedback about what's wrong
3. **Submission Prevention**: Invalid card details now properly prevent form submission
4. **Better UX**: Users can't accidentally submit with invalid payment information
5. **Security**: Reduces failed payment attempts due to invalid card data

## Testing Checklist

✅ Submit with empty card fields → Should show "Card Number", "Expiration Date", "Security Code" errors
✅ Submit with invalid card number → Should show "Please enter a valid card number"
✅ Submit with expired date → Should show "Please enter a valid expiration date"
✅ Submit with invalid CVV → Should show "Please enter a valid security code"
✅ All fields valid → Form submits successfully
