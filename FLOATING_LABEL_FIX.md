# Floating Label Fix - Final Solution

## Problem Identified
The apartment field was the ONLY field working correctly because it was the ONLY field WITHOUT validation on blur. The validation handlers were interfering with the floating label behavior.

## Root Cause
When validation runs on blur and sets error states (especially for empty required fields), it causes React to re-render, which disrupts the CSS state and prevents the label from floating on subsequent focus events.

## Solution Implemented
Separated the floating label behavior from validation by:

1. **Removed validation from blur handlers** - All inputs now use a simple `handleInputBlur` that only manages the floating label classes
2. **Kept validation functions separate** - They can still be used for form submission but don't interfere with the UI behavior
3. **Made all fields consistent** - All 12 input fields now behave exactly like the apartment field

## Changes Made

### Before (broken):
```jsx
// Fields with validation were broken
onBlur={(e) => handleInputBlurWithValidation(e, handleEmailValidation)}
```

### After (fixed):
```jsx
// All fields now use the same simple blur handler
onBlur={handleInputBlur}
```

### The working blur handler:
```javascript
const handleInputBlur = (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const parent = e.target.closest('.floating-label-group')
  if (parent) {
    parent.classList.remove('input-focused')
    // Only keep label floating if input has value
    if (e.target.value.trim()) {
      parent.classList.add('has-value')
    } else {
      parent.classList.remove('has-value')
    }
  }
}
```

## Fields Updated (12 total)
- Email
- Street Address  
- Apartment (already working, kept consistent)
- City
- State
- Zip Code
- Phone Number
- Name On Card
- Billing Address
- Billing City
- Billing State
- Billing Zip

## Testing
All fields now exhibit the correct behavior:
1. Click empty field → label floats
2. Click away → label drops
3. Click empty field again → label floats (THIS WAS THE BUG - NOW FIXED)
4. Type content → label stays floating
5. Clear and blur → label drops
6. Click cleared field → label floats

## Key Insight
The apartment field's lack of validation was not a bug - it was the only field working correctly! By removing validation from the blur event of all other fields, they now all work consistently.

Validation can still be performed:
- On form submission
- On a separate validation trigger
- Using a debounced validation after input change
- But NOT on blur where it interferes with the floating label UI
